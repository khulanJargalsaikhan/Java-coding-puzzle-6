  We'll say a number is cool if it's a multiple of 11 or if it is one more than a multiple of 11. 
	Return true if the given non-negative number is cool. Use the % "modulus" operator 
	we spoke about in the prerequisite section. Watch the lesson on modulus if you need to review


	 EXPECTATIONS:
		isCool(22) --- true 
		isCool(23) --- true 
		isCool(24) --- false
